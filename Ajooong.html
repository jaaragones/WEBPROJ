        <h2> Interest</h2>
        <p> Hello everyone its me John, I am not a  Sporty guy or anything, I'm just a normal guy.
            I like playing online games such as Call Of Duty Mobile and League of Legends. I find watching anime fun and a good way
            of killing time. I also like working in the kitchen, it makes me feel happy whenever I'm cooking  or baking something.

        <h2> Expertise</h2>
        <p> I honestly don't know my Expertise are, I don't know where I am good at. In communication maybe. However, you cannot expect me to 
            engage an conversation especially when I dont know you that much or we're not close. I can also say that I'm  good at making friends
            Im not a bad person im just a shy type, so if  you want to make friend with me dont hesitate to say hi and talk to me. I would also be 
            glad to play online games with y'all. If you guys want to play shoot me a message on my social media accounts.
